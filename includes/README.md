# CoCart `includes` files

This directory contains the core of CoCart. Ideally, the code in this folder should only get the minimum required changes for bug fixing, and any new code should be go in [the src directory](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/blob/dev/plugins/cocart/src/README.md) instead.
