Customizable REST API that lets you build headless ecommerce without limits powered by WooCommerce.

== Description ==

### CoCart: The #1 ecommerce RESTful API built for WooCommerce that scales for headless development.

Take your **WooCommerce** business to the next level with **headless ecommerce** using CoCart.

[CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)'s customizable **frontend** REST API for WooCommerce allows you to separate your CMS from your presentation layer, while developers can use the frameworks and tools they love.

## ü•™ The API

CoCart provides support for managing the users session, alternative options for doing this task do exist; however, their usage can be limited to applications of the same origin as the WordPress installation. This is due to WooCommerce using cookies to store user session tokens. CoCart does not use cookies and is not restricted to using [cookie authentication](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/#cookie-authentication).

CoCart provides the utilities to change this behavior during any cart request and passes the required information to HTTP Header so it can be cached client-side. The use of an HTTP Authorization header is optional allowing users to shop as a guest.

#### üõí Cart API

Add **simple, simple subscription, variable, variable subscriptions** and **grouped products** to the cart either by a **product ID** or **SKU ID**. Update quantities individually or in bulk, add or update customer details and more. The flow is simple and returns an updated cart response every time with all the totals calculated. Coupon and stock checks are done automatically making it easier to simply update your **UX/UI** based on the response.

#### üõçÔ∏è Products API

CoCart allows unauthenticated access to your store products and allows you to filter the queries by product categories, tags, attributes and more. Return even posted reviews and variations as single products.

All the information you need about a product and it's conditions are provided ready to help you with your **UX/UI** development.

## Filter what you need. Get exactly that.

With CoCart, the client can limit the fields, asking for the exact data needed for the response, nothing more. This allows the client have control over their application, and allows the CoCart server to perform more efficiently by only fetching the resources requested.

#### ‚ûï Extras

* Get store information.
* Login the customer/user.
* Logout the customer/user.
* Empty the cart.

As an added bonus for **administrators only**, CoCart also provides the capabilities to:

* Get all carts in session.
* Get details of an individual cart in session.
* View only items added in a cart in session.
* Delete a cart in session.

## ‚ú® Features

CoCart also provides built in features to:

* **NEW**: RateLimit for the API. See [Rate Limit Guide](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/blob/dev/docs/rate-limit-guide.md).
* **NEW**: PRODUCTS API can be cached to get faster response times.
* **NEW**: Attach customers phone number while adding an item to the cart. (Useful for abandoned cart situations.)
* Attach customers email address while adding an item to the cart. (Useful for abandoned cart situations.)
* Override the price for simple or variable products added to cart.
* Load a cart in session via the web. (Useful if you don't have a headless checkout and want to use the native checkout.)
* Supports guest customers.
* Supports basic authentication including the use of email or phone number as the username.
* Support [authentication via WooCommerce's method](https://cocart.dev/authenticating-with-woocommerce-heres-how-you-can-do-it/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).
* Supports multi-site network.
* Does **NOT Cache** the CART API so responses are **fresh** every time.
* Works across multiple domains, CORS ready! **So you can have multiple frontends connected to one backend.**
* Allows you to filter CoCart to be white-labelled.

Included with these features are **over 100+ filters** and **action hooks** for developers to customize API responses or change how CoCart operates with our [code reference](https://coderef.cocart.dev/reference/hooks/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is CoCart free? =

Yes! CoCart‚Äôs core features are absolutely free. [CoCart Pro completes the full cart experience!](https://cocart.xyz/pro/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart)

= How do I start using CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed with the REST API enabled. Then install CoCart and follow the documentation.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Who should use CoCart? =

CoCart is perfect for ecommerce owners and developers who want to create an ecommerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin provides a REST API built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it. [Checkout the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) to get some understanding.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation for CoCart on the [CoCart REST API Docs](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

= Can I add or change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. There are over 100+ filters and action hooks available to do just that. [Checkout the code reference](https://coderef.cocart.dev/reference/hooks/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler in the first place? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler **does not support guest customers**.
- The default session handler **does not store additional data that maybe required to help you**.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session table in the database? =

The default WooCommerce session table only stores the basics of a cart in session. CoCart provides additional data that maybe required to help you and other add-ons/extensions developed by CoCart or third-parties.

Such as when the cart was created. This information is only stored in the browser session.

Also the source of the cart it was last saved. For the web it will be `WooCommerce` and for your headless ecommerce `CoCart`. This lets you know which version of your store your customers are shopping from should you have both web and app versions.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless ecommerce on another domain? =

Yes of course. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can [manually enable it via the filters in the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers) for more advanced control.

= Can I add "WooCommerce Subscriptions" product to the cart? =

Absolutely you can. Any WooCommerce Subscriptions product can be added to the cart the same way a simple or variable product is added to the cart.

= Why can I not add the same item to the cart with a different price? =

Each item added to the cart is assigned a cart item key which is made of four key values: **Product ID**, **Variation ID**, **Variation attributes** and **Cart item data**.

The price and quantity is not taken into account to make this key.

So if you add the same item to the cart but with a different price, the cart will look up the cart item key to see if it's already added to the cart before deciding to either:
    1. Add it as a new item.
    2. Update the quantity of the previous item, in your case the price.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

Not at this time. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignores any REST API from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. However, [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "[TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/)" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Is CoCart right for my business? =

CoCart‚Äôs REST API makes it possible for businesses to build a complete custom storefront. It‚Äôs API-first, enabling your business to take the shopping experience to the next level.

Made by and for developers, CoCart immediately allows you to create sophisticated experiences fast with unlimited possibilities.

With our extensive documentation and resources available, CoCart is a plug and play solution that works out of the box.

Save yourself 80% of a headache and hours of development time.

= Can I use any modern stack or JavaScript framework? =

Yes you can. Use your preferred tools and favorite modern technologies like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and more giving you endless flexibility and customization. Any client that can make http requests to the REST API endpoint can be used to interact with CoCart.

= Why use CoCart and not WooCommerce Store API? =

Checkout the [comparison](https://cocart.xyz/cocart-vs-woocommerces-store-api/) for a detailed look at what CoCart can do.

= Do you have a JavaScript Library? =

Yes we do. You can [find it here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cocart/cocart-rest-api). It doesn't require authentication for guest customers. It supports CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript Modules (ESM). Requests are made with [Axios library](https://github.com/axios/axios) with [support to promises](https://github.com/axios/axios#promises).

= Can I install/update CoCart via Composer? =

Yes. The best method would be to install/update CoCart from the GitHub repository but you can also do so via [https://wpackagist.org/](https://wpackagist.org/search?q=cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce&type=plugin)

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it via the network and all sites will have CoCart enabled.

= Can I enable white labelling for CoCart? =

Yes you can. You will have to edit your `wp-config.php` file to add a new constant. [Details can be found in the documentation](https://cocart.dev/articles/wp-config-php/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart#white-labelling).

= Is CoCart translatable? =

Yes! CoCart is deployed with full translation and localization support via the ‚Äòcart-rest-api-for-woocommerce‚Äô text-domain.
